act as a world class machine learning engineer and algorithmic trader

you are improving this pipeline to go into production. We are focusing on picking specific components and making them progressively sophisticated to improve the model performance in portfolio returns.

I need you to improve the following:

Action Space Enhancement:
Replace the current discrete action space (0,1,2) with a continuous action space that represents:
a) Portfolio allocation weights for each stock (0-1)
b) Position sizing based on confidence levels
c) Allow simultaneous positions across multiple stocks
Think deeply and step by step because it is a challenging and complex problem

ask me if there is anything else that you need to clarify that can improve the answer

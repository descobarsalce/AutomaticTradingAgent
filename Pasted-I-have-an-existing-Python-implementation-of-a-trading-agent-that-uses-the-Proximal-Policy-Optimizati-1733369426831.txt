I have an existing Python implementation of a trading agent that uses the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm from the stable-baselines3 library. The current implementation uses a DummyVecEnv wrapper for environment compatibility, and the agent is trained and evaluated using the MlpPolicy. I would like to enhance this implementation to better suit a broader range of financial trading applications, focusing on flexibility, performance, and maintainability.

Objective:
Design a stateful, extensible trading agent capable of handling diverse financial environments. The agent should:

Use reinforcement learning to optimize portfolio weights or execute trades.
Be scalable and modular for easy integration with various data sources and environments.
Include enhancements to improve its predictive power, training stability, and performance in complex market scenarios.
Requirements:
General Implementation Overview:

Explain the general structure of a reinforcement learning trading agent and how it interacts with financial environments.
Highlight key components such as the environment, policy, training process, and evaluation.
Packages and Libraries to Use:

Primary reinforcement learning framework: stable-baselines3 (PPO or alternatives like SAC, DDPG if suitable).
Financial data handling: pandas, numpy, and any domain-specific libraries (e.g., yfinance or quantstats).
Custom environment design: gym for implementing custom trading environments.
Visualization and debugging: matplotlib or seaborn for plotting performance metrics.
Enhancements to the Existing Code:

Environment Design:
Provide guidelines for designing custom gym environments to simulate trading with realistic constraints (e.g., transaction costs, slippage, and portfolio limits).
Include support for multiple asset trading, not just single assets.
Model Improvements:
Introduce options to use alternative policy networks (e.g., CnnPolicy, custom architectures).
Add support for hyperparameter tuning to optimize the PPO model.
Training Flexibility:
Allow the agent to train on varying time horizons (e.g., daily, weekly) and with different reward structures (e.g., Sharpe ratio, portfolio returns).
Include early stopping criteria to prevent overfitting.
Statefulness:
Add support for maintaining a state object to track portfolio weights, open positions, and cumulative rewards over time.
Evaluation:
Implement evaluation metrics such as cumulative returns, drawdowns, and Sharpe ratio during and after training.
Allow backtesting with historical data for performance validation.
Integration and Modularity:

Provide modular components for:
Data preprocessing and feature extraction.
Customizable reward functions.
Backtesting and logging.
Ensure the architecture supports easy extension (e.g., adding new environments or swapping RL algorithms).

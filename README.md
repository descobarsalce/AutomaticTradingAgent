## Quick Start

1. The platform runs on Replit - no additional setup required
2. Launch the application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py --server.address 0.0.0.0 --server.port 8501
   ```

## Trading Environment

The platform implements a custom Gymnasium environment with:
- Flexible action space for multiple assets
- Sophisticated reward function incorporating:
  - Portfolio returns
  - Risk metrics
  - Trading costs
  - Position holding incentives
- Configurable observation space with technical indicators
- Built-in transaction cost modeling

## Model Configuration

Key configurable parameters:
- Initial portfolio balance
- Transaction costs
- Position size limits
- Risk management thresholds
- Observation window size
- Training episode length

## Performance Metrics

The platform tracks:
- Total Returns
- Sharpe Ratio
- Sortino Ratio
- Maximum Drawdown
- Information Ratio
- Win Rate
- Position Metrics
- Trading Volume

## Data Sources

Supported data providers:
- Alpha Vantage (real-time and historical)
- Yahoo Finance (historical)
- Custom SQL Database (cached data)

## Component Details

### Portfolio Manager

1. Lower or Remove the “0.2” Minimum Action Threshold
Right now, you force a minimum of 20% exposure for any positive action. Specifically:

python
Copy code
desired_exposure = max(0.2, abs(action)) * self.max_position_pct
This line means that if your agent outputs any positive action below 0.2, it automatically jumps to 0.2. That can be too large of a purchase for the agent’s current balance—especially if the share price is high.

How to fix it
Option A: Remove the max(0.2, ...) and just do abs(action):

python
Copy code
desired_exposure = abs(action) * self.max_position_pct
This way, a small action leads to a smaller buy (or sell).

Option B: Lower the threshold from 0.2 to 0.05 or even 0.01.
For example:

python
Copy code
desired_exposure = max(0.05, abs(action)) * self.max_position_pct
Either approach lets the agent buy much smaller amounts of shares instead of being forced to buy a large chunk that it cannot afford.

2. Relax the min_transaction_size or Lower the Share Price
You currently have:

python
Copy code
self.min_transaction_size = min_transaction_size  # default = 1
and in step() you do:

python
Copy code
min_transaction_value = self.min_transaction_size * current_price
...
amount = max(base_amount, min_transaction_value) ...
If your dataset has very high “Close” prices, then min_transaction_value can easily exceed your entire balance. For example, if the close price is $20,000 and min_transaction_size = 1, your agent needs at least $20,000 to buy 1 share—more than your $10,000 initial balance.

How to fix it
Allow fractional shares without a min_transaction_size.
If partial share trading is valid for your domain, set min_transaction_size = 0 (or a very small number, e.g. 0.001). That way, you never force the agent to buy at least 1 share at $20k.

Reduce share prices in your dataset.

If your dataset is artificially high priced (like Bitcoin or certain large-cap stocks), you can scale the price down in a preprocessing step.
Example: If your data is in the $20,000 range, divide everything by 10 or 100 to simulate smaller prices.
Decrease desired_exposure further.
If you cannot alter the data, you can keep partial shares but ensure that the maximum forced buy is well below the total balance.

Combining this with item #1 (removing the 20% minimum) typically resolves “Insufficient balance” rejections.

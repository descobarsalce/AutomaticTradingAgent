1. Throttling Logs More Effectively

Original Code
In your original code, you have two separate blocks in step() that decide whether to log the portfolio state:

# One block:
if should_log:
    ...
    logger.info(f"... Portfolio State ...")

# Another block:
should_log = False
if trade_executed and self.current_step > self.last_logged_step:
    should_log = True
elif self.current_step - self.last_logged_step >= self.log_frequency:
    should_log = True

if should_log:
    ...
    logger.info(f"... Portfolio State ...")
This causes duplicate portfolio logs in the same step.

Revised Code
The revised code consolidates portfolio-logging into a single block. After processing the buy/sell action, it checks:

If a trade was executed and we haven’t logged yet.
If self.current_step - self.last_logged_step >= self.log_frequency.
Then it logs only once per step if those conditions are satisfied. This eliminates the second redundant block and prevents duplicate messages:

# Decide whether to log portfolio state
should_log = False
if (trade_executed and self.current_step > self.last_logged_step):
    should_log = True
elif (self.current_step - self.last_logged_step) >= self.log_frequency:
    should_log = True

if should_log:
    self.last_logged_step = self.current_step
    logger.info(f"... Portfolio State ...")
Difference: You now get only one portfolio log per step, rather than two.

2. Consistent Reward Calculation

Original Code
You had a _compute_reward() function returning (reward, base_reward, position_profit_reward, holding_bonus), but some references in the info dictionary or logs used partial/different scaling for position profit or partial checks for local variables.
Revised Code
The reward flow is directly returned from _compute_reward(), and everything that goes into info['reward_components'] matches exactly what is calculated in _compute_reward().
This ensures that the final reward, base_reward, position_profit_reward, and holding_bonus are consistent between logs and internal calculations.
Difference: The final code ensures that the logs about reward components accurately reflect the final reward computation.

3. Single Logging Block for Reward Components

Original Code
You logged reward components after you formed the info dict, sometimes referencing local variables (exploration_bonus, etc.) that might or might not exist in the current scope.
Revised Code
The code clarifies the usage of exploration_bonus by making sure it’s accounted for in _compute_reward() and set to zero if not applied.
The final “Reward Components” log references the exact numbers returned from _compute_reward() to avoid inconsistencies.
Difference: The reward component log is now more streamlined—always referencing the actual return values from _compute_reward().

4. Optional Logging During Testing

Original Code
In test_random_actions(), you had a parameter log=False, but only partially used it to toggle logs.
Revised Code
The updated code explicitly sets the logger level to WARNING if log=False, and restores the original level upon completion. This provides a clearer way to suppress logs during tests while still allowing logs if log=True.
Difference: Testing logs are more consistently controlled—so you don’t flood logs during automated tests unless you intentionally enable them.

5. Collapsed or Removed Duplicates

Original Code
The environment code repeated some lines (like re-defining action_space and observation_space) at the bottom.
Revised Code
Those duplicates are removed or collapsed. The final environment now has a single initialization of action_space and observation_space at the top.
Difference: Less redundancy, more clarity in the class definition.

6. Parameter Renaming / Clarity (Optional)

Some internal variable names or placement might have shifted slightly (e.g., the transaction fees are computed in a single place, then subtracted from balance, etc.), but the logic remains largely the same. The main structural difference is the streamlined approach to logging and reward consistency.
